IOS Application Posting Process
===============================

https://itunesconnect.apple.com


STEPS TO RESERVING YOUR APP NAME FOREVER
========================================
Log in to https://itunesconnect.apple.com
Click Manage Your Apps
Click Add New Application
Complete the basic information, including the app name
Upload temporary icons and screenshots (for iPhone 4 & iPhone 5)
Change the app status to “Waiting for Upload”
Create a very simple app and use the new bundle ID
Submit the App to the App Store for Review (as you normally would)
After the status has changed to “Waiting for Review” go into iTunes Connect
Click Manage Your Apps > View Details > Binary Details
Click Reject this Binary
This will set the status of your application to “Developer Rejected”. Since you have successfully submitted a binary and had a “Waiting for Review” status it can sit in that status forever, therefore your app name is parked forever! Apple considers it a “real” app since it was officially submitted. So now sit on your great app name until you’re ready to finish development.




App names: MyWorld21C , MyGlory - Generated
